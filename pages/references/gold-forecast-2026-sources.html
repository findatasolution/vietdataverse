                </div>
                <p class="text-stone-300 text-sm leading-relaxed mb-4">Summary: Goldman Sachs raised its December 2026 gold price target to $5,400/oz, up from a prior forecast of $4,900, driven by expectations that private-sector investors — who bought gold to hedge global policy risks — will not liquidate holdings in 2026, effectively lifting the price floor. The bank also expects central bank buying to average 60 tonnes per month in 2026 as emerging market central banks continue diversifying reserves away from the US dollar. Silver futures also surged alongside the announcement, climbing approximately 3.86% to $100.10/oz.</p>
                <p class="text-stone-200 text-sm leading-relaxed mb-2">Goldman Raises Year-End Gold Forecast to $5,400 an Ounce.
                        (Bloomberg) -- Goldman Sachs Group Inc. raised its year-end gold price forecast by more than 10%, reflecting growing private-sector diversification into bullion on top of already-strong demand from central banks and exchange-traded funds.
                        The bank raised its December 2026 price target to $5,400 an ounce, from a prior forecast of $4,900, on the assumption that private investors who have bought gold as a hedge against macro policy risks will maintain these positions through the end of the year, analysts including Daan Struyven and Lina Thomas wrote in a note dated Jan. 21. Unlike previous hedges tied to specific events, such as the November 2024 US election, positions taken against perceived risks, such as fiscal sustainability, may not fully resolve this year and are therefore “stickier,” the analysts said.
                        Gold has risen more than 70% over the past 12 months, smashing successive records on a scorching rally that has continued into the early weeks of this year. Capital is being driven toward haven assets as global power dynamics shift dramatically and President Donald Trump renews his attacks on the Federal Reserve, shaking faith in the independence of the US central bank. Central-bank buying is expected to average 60 tons a month in 2026, with monetary authorities in emerging markets “likely to continue the structural diversification of their reserves into gold,” the analysts said.
                        Western ETF holdings, meanwhile, have increased by around 500 tons since the start of 2025, outpacing predictions based solely on US interest-rate cuts. Goldman expects a further 50 basis points of Fed easing in 2026.
                        As concerns mount over long-term monetary and fiscal policy trajectories in major economies, gold has also been boosted by demand linked to the so-called debasement trade, including physical purchases by high-net-worth families and investor call-option buying, Goldman said.
                        Risks to the upgraded forecast are “significantly skewed to the upside because private-sector investors may diversify further on lingering global policy uncertainty,” the analysts wrote. “That said, a sharp reduction in perceived risks around the long-run path for global fiscal/monetary policy would pose downside risk if it were to cause liquidation of macro policy hedges.”

                <p class="text-stone-300 text-sm leading-relaxed mb-4">Summary: On January 30, 2026, silver plummeted 30% — its worst single day since 1980 — settling at $78.53/oz for futures, while spot gold dropped approximately 9% to $4,895.22/oz, after President Trump nominated Kevin Warsh, a hawkish ex-Fed official, to succeed Jerome Powell as Federal Reserve Chair. The nomination calmed investor fears that Trump would install a loyalist to push aggressive rate cuts, reducing the safe-haven premium built into precious metals. The US dollar strengthened sharply on the news, further pressuring metals, though gold still remained more than 14% above its year-start levels.</p>
                <p class="text-stone-300 text-sm leading-relaxed mb-4">Silver plunges 30% in worst day since 1980, gold tumbles as Warsh pick eases Fed independence fear.
                    Gold and silver prices plunged Friday, as President Donald Trump’s nomination for the next chair of the Federal Reserve, Kevin Warsh, appeared to relieve concerns about the central bank’s independence and sent the dollar soaring.
                    Spot silver was down 28% at $83.45 an ounce, trading near its lows of the day. Silver futures plummeted 31.4% to settle at $78.53, marking its worst day since March 1980.
                    Meanwhile, spot gold shed around 9% to trade at $4,895.22 an ounce. Gold futures dropped 11.4% to settle at $4,745.10.
                    The sharp moves down were initially triggered by reports of Warsh’s nomination. However, they gained steam in afternoon U.S. trading as investors who piled into the metals raced to book profits. Metals were also under pressure as the dollar spiked higher, making it more expensive for foreign investors to buy gold and silver and spoiling the theory that metals would replace the greenback as the globe’s reserve currency.
                    The dollar index last traded around 0.8% higher.
                    “This is getting crazy,” said Matt Maley, equity strategist at Miller Tabak. “Most of this is probably ‘forced selling.’ This has been the hottest asset for day traders and other short-term traders recently. So, there has been some leverage built up in silver. With the huge decline today, the margin calls went out.”
                    Trump picks Warsh National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett had been the favorite to replace Powell for some time, but Warsh became the front-runner in prediction markets in recent days.
                    In a note on Friday morning, Evercore ISI’s Krishna Guha said the market was “trading Warsh hawkish.”
                    “The Warsh pick should help stabilize the dollar some and reduce (though not eliminate) the asymmetric risk of deep extended dollar weakness by challenging debasement trades – which is also why gold and silver are sharply lower,” the firm’s vice chairman said.
                    “But, we advise against overdoing the Warsh hawkish trade across asset markets – and even see some risk of a whipsaw. We see Warsh as a pragmatist not an ideological hawk in the tradition of the independent conservative central banker.”
                    Claudio Wewel, FX strategist at J. Safra Sarasin Sustainable Asset Management, told CNBC’s “Squawk Box Europe” on Friday that a “perfect storm” of geopolitical tensions had helped precious metals move higher this year, pointing to the U.S. capture of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and Washington’s threats to use military force in Greenland and Iran.
                    More recently, he said, speculation over who would be nominated as the next Fed chair had been influencing metals markets.
                    “The market has clearly been pricing the risk of a much more dovish contender, that’s been largely helping the gold price along with other precious metal prices. Over the last 24 hours, the news flow has changed a little bit,” Wewel said, prior to Trump’s announcement.
                    ‘Even good assets can sell-off’
                    Gold and silver both enjoyed record-smashing rallies in 2025, surging 66% and 135%, respectively, over the course of the year.
                    Coeur Mining lost 17%. Silver ETFs were dragged into the action, with the ProShares Ultra Silver fund last seen more than 62% lower. The iShares Silver Trust ETF lost 31%. Both funds were headed for their worst days on record.
                    Precious metals have been on a stellar rally over the past 12 months, amid broader market volatility, the decline of the U.S. dollar, bubbling geopolitical tensions and concerns about the independence of the Federal Reserve.
                    Katy Stoves, investment manager at British wealth management firm Mattioli Woods, told CNBC on Friday morning that the moves were likely “a market-wide reassessment of concentration risk.”
                    “Just as tech stocks — particularly AI-related names — have dominated market attention and capital flows, gold has similarly seen intense positioning and crowding,” she said. “When everyone is leaning the same way, even good assets can sell off as positions get unwound. The parallel isn’t accidental: both represent areas where capital has flooded in based on powerful narratives, and concentrated positions eventually face their day of reckoning.”
                    Meanwhile, Toni Meadows, head of investment at BRI Wealth Management, contended that gold’s run to the $5,000 mark had happened “too easily.” He noted that the unwinding of the greenback had supported gold prices, but that the dollar had appeared to stabilize.
                    “Central bank buying has driven the longer-term rally but this has tailed off in recent months,” he said. “The case for further reserve diversification is still there though as Trump’s trade policies and intervention in foreign affairs will make a lot of countries nervous about holding U.S. assets, especially those countries in the emerging markets or aligned to China or Russia. Silver will mirror the direction of gold, so it is not surprising to see falls there.”

                </div>
                <p class="text-stone-300 text-sm leading-relaxed mb-4">Summary: On February 13, 2026, gold recovered swiftly from a weekly low near $4,950, climbing back toward the $5,000 psychological level after a 3.5% sell-off the prior day driven by AI-sector fears and a stronger US dollar following upbeat jobs data. Following the release of US CPI for January — which came in at 2.4% YoY, below the 2.5% estimate and down from December's 2.7% — gold reclaimed the $5,000 level as softer inflation reinforced expectations for Fed rate cuts later in 2026. OCBC strategists identified $5,090–$5,120 as key resistance and $4,960/$4,720 as downside support zones.</p>
                <p class="text-stone-300 text-sm leading-relaxed mb-4">Gold remains below $5,000 as traders await US CPI for Fed rate cut cues. Gold (XAU/USD) sticks to modest intraday gains through the early European session on Friday, though it remains below the $5,000 psychological mark as traders keenly await the release of the US consumer inflation figures. The crucial Consumer Price Index (CPI) report will be looked upon for more cues about the Federal Reserve's (Fed) policy path. The outlook will, in turn, play a key role in influencing the near-term US Dollar (USD) price dynamics and provide some meaningful impetus to the non-yielding bullion.
                In the meantime, the upbeat US Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP) report released on Wednesday forced investors to scale back their bets for a Fed rate cut in March. This keeps the USD Index (DXY), which tracks the Greenback against a basket of currencies, afloat above a two-week low, which, in turn, triggered the overnight decline in Gold prices. That said, traders are still pricing in the possibility that the US central bank will lower borrowing costs two more times in 2026. Furthermore, Thursday's unimpressive US Jobless Claims data caps the USD.
                The US Department of Labor (DOL) reported that the number of US citizens submitting new applications for unemployment insurance fell to 227K during the week ending February 7. This was higher than 222K estimated, but lower than the previous week’s revised 232K print. Moreover, Continuing Claims rose to 1.862 million during the week ending January 31, highlighting the underlying weakness in the labor market that has been prevalent over the past year. This, in turn, acts as a tailwind for the USD and revives demand for the Gold.
                Furthermore, a turnaround in the global risk sentiment – as depicted by a generally weaker tone around the equity markets – turns out to be another factor driving flows toward safe-haven Gold. It remains to be seen, however, if the XAU/USD pair can build on the momentum or if bulls opt to wait for the crucial US Consumer Price Index (CPI) report before placing fresh bets.
                Gold’s mixed technical setup warrants caution for aggressive traders
                The overnight breakdown through the weekly trading range could be seen as a key trigger for the XAU/USD bears. The lack of follow-through selling and resilience below the $4,900 mark warrants some caution. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) turns higher through the Signal line near the zero level, and the histogram flips positive, suggesting a transition to improving bullish momentum.
                Moreover, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 44.72 (neutral) after rebounding from oversold territory, supporting a tentative recovery in intraday tone. With the RSI still below 50, rallies could be capped, whereas a MACD slip back beneath the Signal line and zero would reassert bearish pressure and extend consolidation. Nevertheless, the momentum remains supported while the MACD holds above zero and the positive histogram widens, though a contracting histogram would hint at fading impetus.

                <p class="text-stone-300 text-sm leading-relaxed mb-4">Bank of America analyst Michael Hartnett forecasts gold reaching $6,000/oz by spring 2026, citing historical bull market patterns that average approximately 300% gains over 43 months. BofA's Michael Widmer projects gold averaging $4,538/oz for full-year 2026, noting that mine supply is declining 2% while all-in sustaining costs are rising to approximately $1,600/oz. Widmer states that gold remains "underinvested" despite being technically overbought, and that only a 14% increase in investment demand would be needed to achieve the $6,000 target.</p>

                <p class="text-stone-300 text-sm leading-relaxed mb-4">Goldman Sachs, in a September 2025 publication, forecast gold prices to rise by approximately 6% by mid-2026, underpinned by continued structural demand from central banks and private investors hedging against macroeconomic and geopolitical policy risks. The bank cited the "debasement trade" — driven by concerns over long-term fiscal sustainability in major economies — as a key demand driver alongside Western ETF inflows that had already exceeded 500 tonnes since the start of 2025. Goldman subsequently upgraded its end-2026 target to $5,400/oz in January 2026 as those demand trends accelerated beyond initial expectations.</p>

Morgan's Global Research page notes that gold surged 55% in 2025, surpassing $4,000/oz for the first time, and forecasts gold averaging $5,055/oz in Q4 2026 and rising to $5,400/oz by end-2027, driven by central bank and investor demand averaging approximately 585 tonnes per quarter. The bank highlights that a reallocation of just 0.5% of foreign US asset holdings into gold could alone drive prices to $6,000/oz, illustrating the scale of potential demand. J.P. Morgan maintains strong conviction in gold's medium-term bull case, citing reserve diversification and persistent macro uncertainty as structural tailwinds.</p>

Geopolitical tensions were simultaneously elevated following the US capture of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and threats against the Iranian regime amid a crackdown on protesters. HSBC forecast that trading momentum could carry gold to $5,000/oz in H1 2026.</p>

Morgan's baseline at $4,753/oz, with a longer-term super-cycle target of $7,000/oz by 2030 cited by some analysts. Key structural drivers identified include central bank reserve diversification — especially from China, India, and Poland — declining confidence in the US dollar and Treasury bonds, demographic shifts, and global debt sustainability concerns. The article cautions that a stronger dollar, rapid disinflation, or geopolitical resolution could undermine the bullish outlook, with a price floor near $3,900 seen as the consensus downside anchor.</p>

The bank also noted that Western ETF holdings had risen by around 500 tonnes since early 2025, exceeding predictions based on Fed rate cuts alone, and expected a further 50 basis points of Fed easing in 2026. Goldman stated that upside risks were "significantly skewed" given the potential for further private-sector diversification amid lingering global policy uncertainty.</p>

For 2026, the WGC outlines four scenarios: rangebound performance under consensus conditions; a "shallow slip" yielding 5–15% gains; a "doom loop" (risk-off environment) producing 15–30% upside; and a "reflation return" scenario causing a 5–20% decline. Central bank purchase volumes and gold recycling trends are identified as key wildcards that could either sustain or pressure gold prices depending on how macro conditions evolve.</p>
